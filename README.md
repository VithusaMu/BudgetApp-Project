# BudgetApp

## Description
A simple and organized Budget Management application using **WPF** and **C#** that allows users to track their spending by creating categories, adding expenses, and reviewing their data with built-in sorting and filtering tools. Users can also save their budget data to a database or load it back into the app for continued use.
This project focuses on giving users an overview of their finances while providing flexible tools to manage and analyse expenses.

## Purpose
This project was my final assignment in App Development 1 in the Computer Science program at John Abbott College. The goal was to design and implement a functional application with proper data handling, user interaction, and UI. We also created an API for the budget application to call SQL queries to the database.
